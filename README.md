<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<h3> This is a repository for a school project done in the first year of Bachelor degree in computer science at the University Institute of Technology in Maubeuge, France. </h3>
<p> The goal of the project was to code the game "Mastermind" in python, the rules are quite simple : </p>
<ul>
  <li> 2 players </li>
  <li> First player is choosing a secret code of colors </li>
  <li> Second player tries to guess </li>
  <li> After each guess, the first one says how many color aren't placed well and how many are </li>
 </ul>
 <p> Of course those rules are really simplified, and they aren't the exact rules that we used, especially for the number of colors to guess, the number of colors possible
, the number of rounds possible to play </p>
<p> As for the player who needs to guess, we've programmed an AI to resolve it as fast as possible, for that we used the algorithm of Knuth. </p>
<p> We also coded a little extension that use a graphical interface with the Tkinter library. </p>
<h4> This was a project in group of 2, I did the coding part, my colleague did the report which I did not include because it is in French. </h4>
